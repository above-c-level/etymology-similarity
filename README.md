Let's pretend this project is already done for funsies, in that case I'd expect (or hope for) the readme to look something like:

This project attempts to find etymological similarities based on data downloaded from wiktionary. Everything has been converted into a DAG (assuming it's not too large to include in the repo), where each word points to the words that it evolved into.

Ideally it would instead be a tree, but due to some words such as [Aukan taa](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taa#Aukan) coming from multiple different sources, there is no way for a tree to work.

The LCA (Least Common Ancestor) of any two words given this DAG must be a word that both words are purported to have evolved from. For example, the graph of the the Spanish word [*blanco*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blanco#Spanish) might be [Proto-Indo-European **bʰleyǵ-*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/b%CA%B0ley%C7%B5-) → [Proto-Germanic **blinkaną*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/blinkan%C4%85) → [Proto-Germanic **blankaz*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/blankaz) → [Proto-West Germanic **blank*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-West_Germanic/blank) → [Latin *blancus*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blancus#Latin) → [Spanish *blanco*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blanco#Spanish), while and English [*black*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bleak#English) may have [Proto-Indo-European **bʰleyǵ-*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/b%CA%B0ley%C7%B5-) →
[Proto-Germanic **blaikaz*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/blaikaz) → [Proto-West Germanic **blaik*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-West_Germanic/blaik) → [Old English *blæc*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bl%C3%A6c#Old_English) → [Middle English *blak*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blak#Middle_English) → [English *black*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/black#English).

Then the least common ancestor given these two (admittently heavily simplified) trees is [Proto-Indo-European **bʰleyǵ-*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/b%CA%B0ley%C7%B5-), indicating that Spanish [*blanco*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blanco#Spanish) and English [*black*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/black#English) may share a common ancestor.

To build this graph yourself, you will need the English Wiktionary articles multistream bz2 file and the english Wiktionary articles multistream titles bz2 file, both placed in the `dumps` folder. Both are available as Wikimedia Dumps [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/). Mine were downloaded on 2024-06-12. Direct links to these are [the index here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/enwiktionary-latest-pages-articles-multistream-index.txt.bz2) and [the articles here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/enwiktionary-latest-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2).

Honestly I have no idea if this will work at all due to inconsistencies in formatting and the fact that Wiktionary is edited by humans. But, assuming it does, you will hopefully be able to compile the graph by running `build_graph.py`. I'm not sure how I'll handle the graph from there, maybe just a lil CLI thing?
